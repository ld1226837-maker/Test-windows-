# Truff Seeder Rework — Final Report

Date: 2026-09-21
Base: Truff-windows/android-app-payments-split

## Executive status

Implementation work for Steps 1–9 has been applied to the Windows and Android project trees. The final release is **not runtime-verified** in this environment because dependency installation did not complete. This report deliberately separates implemented/static work from runtime verification.

## Step 9 corrections

- Removed `newId()` calls from `verificationSeed.ts` and replaced verification IDs with deterministic `ver-*` IDs.
- Corrected the audited August snack-sale tax fixture from 104 to 105.
- Removed ambient `Math.random()` from `loadtest.ts`.
- Synchronized corrected shared files between Windows and Android.

## Static checks

The Step-9 report records these checks as completed:

- No `newId()` remains in `verificationSeed.ts`.
- No `Math.random()` remains in `loadtest.ts`.
- No stale August `104` tax literal remains in the verification fixture.
- Corrected shared-file hashes match between Windows and Android.
- Seeder verification scripts and `tsx` metadata are present.

## Runtime verification not completed

The environment could not complete:

```text
npm install --no-audit --no-fund --ignore-scripts
```

Consequently no claim is made that the following passed:

- full Vitest suite
- TypeScript typecheck
- `verify:seeders`
- Light load-test audit
- Medium load-test audit
- 12/14-month runtime determinism
- clear-to-zero runtime checks
- backup round-trip
- timezone checks
- Android Gradle/Tauri build
- device timing/UI click-through

## Release recommendation

Treat the supplied Step-9/Step-10 packages as **implementation-complete but verification-pending**, not as a fully verified production release.

Run the project's verification commands in a normal Node/npm environment, then perform the Android build and device/UI checks. Record the actual outputs in this report before declaring the release fully verified.

## Addendum — 21 September 2026 verification session

This session attempted to execute the full matrix in `REMAINING-WORK.md`. Results below use the same evidence standard as the rest of this report: a step is marked `PASS` only if the corresponding command was actually run, and `NOT VERIFIED` with a stated reason otherwise.

### Completed this session

| Check                                  | Result   | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| §29 Windows/Android shared-file parity | **PASS** | SHA-256 computed directly on both extracted packages for all 10 listed shared files (`loadtest.ts`, `loadtest-gen.ts`, `loadtest-ledger.ts`, `seed-photo.ts`, `verificationSeed.ts`, `loadtest-ledger.test.ts`, `LoadTestCard.tsx`, `verify-loadtest.ts`, `verify-math.ts`, `package.json`). All 10 hashes matched exactly between packages. |

### What would unblock the rest

1. **§3–25** (all Node/TypeScript-level checks) only need `npm install` to succeed. That requires either running this on a machine/environment with normal npm registry access, or enabling network egress for this sandbox.
2. **§26–28** (Android build, Android device test, Windows UI test) are hardware/OS-bound and cannot be completed in any sandboxed container — they need to be run on your actual Windows machine and an Android device/emulator, per the doc's own §26/§27/§28 instructions.

### Updated overall status

```text
Implementation:            COMPLETE
Windows/Android parity:    VERIFIED (§29 PASS, real SHA-256 match)
Runtime verification:      IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT VERIFIED
Production release:        NOT READY — do not represent as fully verified
