/**
 * Print / Download PDF / Share on WhatsApp / Copy — the row-level action
 * block that turf bookings (`TurfTab`) and snack sales (`SnackSalesList`)
 * both render per-record. Pulled out once both had grown byte-for-byte
 * identical copies of these four buttons (Step 18 added them to bookings,
 * Step 19 mirrored them to snack sales) so a future change to this block
 * — a new action, a wording tweak, a different icon — happens once
 * instead of twice and can't quietly drift the way the pre-Step-18
 * Print/Download buttons already had before being compared directly.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT used by `BillsTab`/`BillActions.tsx`: bills render a
 * larger, labeled 4–5 button grid (including a UPI-pay option gated on
 * Settings) as their primary action surface, not a compact icon row
 * inside a list item — a different UI weight for the app's most formal
 * record type, not an oversight. If bills ever move to this same compact
 * treatment, `BillActions.tsx` should compose this component rather than
 * this component growing bill-specific props.
 *
 * Takes an already-built `ReceiptDoc` rather than a `TurfBooking` /
 * `SnackSale` — the caller still owns `bookingReceipt(b)` /
 * `snackSaleReceipt(s)`, so this component has no record-type-specific
 * logic of its own and needs no changes if a third record type
 * (invoices, if `BillsTab` ever adopts this shape) is added later.
