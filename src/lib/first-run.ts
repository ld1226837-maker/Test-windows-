/**
 * The plan's Section 6 first-run checklist: Business details → Turf rates →
 * Courts & durations → Snack catalog → Payment methods → Printer/receipt
 * settings → Backup setup → First test booking.
 *
 * Every step here is SELF-REPORTED (the owner ticks it, nothing is inferred
 * from data) — deliberately, not for lack of trying. Most of the settings
 * this checklist points at (turf rates, slot durations, printer/receipt
 * settings) ship pre-seeded with sensible working defaults (see
 * DEFAULT_TURF_RATES in ops.ts, DEFAULT_PRINT_SETTINGS in print.ts), and this
 * install's own defaults already carry a real-looking business name/address/
 * phone — so "is a value present" can't tell a fresh install the owner
 * hasn't touched yet from one they've already reviewed and are happy with.
 * A checkbox the owner controls is honest about that; a checklist that's
 * silently 6/8 "done" on first launch because of seed data would not be.
 *
 * The two genuinely data-safe exceptions (`lastBackupAt`, first booking) are
 * intentionally NOT special-cased here — see `useFirstRunChecklist`'s doc
 * comment for why they're still plain checkboxes too, for consistency.
