/**
 * Merging turf bookings + snack sales into ONE bill, and putting everything
 * back when that bill is un-merged or deleted.
 *
 * The whole merge is a single Dexie transaction: the bill row, the
 * merged_into_bill_id flags and every ledger write land together or not at
 * all, so a failure can never leave a half-reversed tab.
 *
 * Money rules (see lib/dues.ts for the read side):
 * - Each source's *net remaining* tab charge is reversed against the exact
 *   amount that source put on the tab (never capped at the live tab balance),
 *   tagged `merge_reverse` + the source ref so it can be put back exactly.
 * - When "on tab" is ticked the merged bill posts ONE charge for the whole
 *   outstanding amount. Net effect on the tab is `outstanding - alreadyOnTab`,
 *   but as two traceable rows instead of one silently netted figure.
 * - The bill's `amount_paid` is what was actually COLLECTED on the sources —
 *   an "On tab" bill is not revenue received.
