# Courts: one module, one set of rules

All court capacity, pricing and utilisation math lives in `src/lib/courts.ts`.
Nothing else should count courts, multiply by courts, or read `b.courts` for
pricing/utilisation math — import from there. `court_ids` is the named-court
audit/occupancy field; `courts` remains the count multiplier.

## Model

A venue has `total_courts` courts, ids `c1…cN` (Settings → Turf rates lets you
name them; blank names read "Court N"). A booking takes `courts` of them for
`[start, start + hours)` and stores the ids it holds in `court_ids`.

**Assignment is automatic.** The app gives a booking the lowest court id(s)
free for its WHOLE window (`assignCourts`). A booking holds the same court
start to finish, so a window can be refused even when a head-count says a
court is free at every minute (Court 1 busy early, Court 2 busy late). When
editing, the booking keeps its current court(s) if they are still free, so a
plain edit never shuffles the court.

**Legacy rows.** Bookings saved before named courts have no `court_ids`.
`resolveCourtIds` gives them a deterministic assignment (date, start,
created_at, id order, around already-assigned rows) and `backfillCourtIds`
(ops.ts, run from TurfTab) persists it, idempotently. It also re-homes a
booking whose court no longer exists after the venue's court count is lowered.

## What each helper is for

| Helper                                           | Used by                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `buildCourtOccupancy`                            | minute → set of court ids in use (past-midnight spill, `excludeId` for edits)                  |
| `assignCourts` / `freeCourtIdsFor`               | automatic assignment; "N/M free" per slot = courts free for the whole slot                     |
| `resolveCourtIds` / `courtLabel` / `courtsLabel` | which court(s) a booking holds; display names                                                  |
| `buildOccupancy`                                 | (count-only, kept for compatibility) minute → courts in use                                    |
| `freeCourtsFor` / `windowFits`                   | slot grid "N/M free" and greyed-out slots                                                      |
| `selectionFits`                                  | save-time guard — raising the court stepper after picking slots                                |
| `clampToVenue`                                   | keeps the working court count ≤ `total_courts`                                                 |
| `turfPrice` / `effectiveRatePerHour`             | price = one-court price × courts; stored rate is per court per hour                            |
| `storedTurfAmount`                               | ONE legacy rule (zero `turf_amount` ⇒ hours × rate × courts) for bill math, receipt and export |
| `courtHourSegments` / `utilisationPct`           | Dashboard utilisation grid (court-hours and % of capacity)                                     |

## Bugs this replaced

1. Raising the court stepper after picking slots could overbook the venue (no re-check on save).
2. Editing a booking whose `courts` exceeded a lowered `total_courts` priced N courts but saved fewer.
3. Excel export used `??` and printed Amount 0 for legacy rows that the receipt / bill math rebuilt — sheet and grand total disagreed.
4. Utilisation grid excluded merged bookings, contradicting `docs/calculation-rules.md` §2 (a merged booking still occupied the court). It now also shows % of capacity per cell.
5. Occupancy kept the court count in a shared mutable variable read by a closure — fragile; each booking now supplies its own.

## Current limits

Court-wise revenue reports are not a separate report yet. Manually picking or
moving a booking to a specific court remains unsupported (assignment is
automatic by design). The utilisation grid reports court-hours and % of venue
capacity; named court ids are retained for occupancy and audit.
