/**
 * Hand-built, deterministic dataset spanning three real months (July,
 * August & September 2026) — the SAME data scripts/verify-math.ts audits
 * the calculators against. September is the multi-court golden block
 * (MC-1…MC-8, see EXPECTED_SEP below). It exercises every rule in
 * docs/calculation-rules.md at once:
 * merged bookings, cancelled bookings, paid/partial/unpaid bills, the
 * UTC-slice month-boundary trap (bill VER-INV-0002 is 31 Jul 20:00 UTC =
 * 1 Aug 01:30 IST and must bucket into August), and customer identity
 * matching by phone vs. name. Every row is tagged with a "VER-"
 * document-number prefix (and customer ids prefixed "ver-cust-") so
 * `clearVerificationData()` can remove exactly these rows without touching
 * real data.
 *
 * Seeding also turns on GST 18% + a 5% service charge, because the
 * hand-computed expectations in verify-math.ts are computed under that tax
 * setup. GST being ON applies to more than the bills here: none of this
 * dataset's turf bookings/snack sales carry a frozen tax_amount (that's only
 * set by ops.ts's freezeTax() at real creation time), so biz.ts's
 * grossWithTax() taxes them live too, same as a legacy pre-snapshot bill
 * would (calculation-rules.md §4).
 *
 * Expected headline figures (from scripts/verify-math.ts):
 *   July    — revenue 4920, collected 3045, expenses 400, profit 3600,
 *             dues 1875, tax 920
 *   August  — revenue 7935, collected 4400, expenses 400, profit 6050,
 *             dues 3535, tax 1485
 *   Combined revenue 12855, collected 7445, dues 5410, tax 2405.
 *
 * Per-customer (lifetime over ALL seeded rows, tax-inclusive — same GST
 * setup as above; includes the September multi-court block):
 *   Ravi  — turf dues 6764, bill dues 1960, total owed 8724
 *           (turf: TB-1 1076 + TB-5 1230 + MC-1 2952 + MC-7 1230 + MC-8 276)
 *   Priya — turf dues 4064, bill dues 2337, total owed 6401
 *           (turf: TB-2 184 + TB-6 345 + MC-2 3535; bills: INV-3 615 +
 *           MC-BILL-6 1722 — MC-6's merged money sits on the bill)
 *   (8724 + 6401 = 15125 = 1875 July + 3535 Aug + 9715 Sep period dues.)
 *
 * NOTE on "fully paid" bookings: TB-2 and TB-6 have advance_paid equal to the
 * PRE-tax total_amount. Real bookings store the tax-inclusive gross in
 * advance_paid, but these rows carry no frozen tax_amount, so the live GST
 * fallback applies and ₹184 (TB-2) and ₹345 (TB-6) of tax is still owed.
 * That is intentional — it exercises the live-tax fallback — and is already
 * baked into the dues figures above.
