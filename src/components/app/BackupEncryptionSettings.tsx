 * The passphrase used to encrypt every backup archive before it leaves this

 * (`BackupCard`) as well as the Telegram/local full backup
 * (`TelegramBackupCard`). Both cards render this component, since either one
 * can be the first backup a person tries: `readBackupPassphrase`/
 * `writeBackupPassphrase` (backup-passphrase.ts) are the single source of
 * truth either way, so there's nothing to keep in sync between the two
 * copies. `onSaved` lets a card that only shows this conditionally (see
 * `BackupCard`) know to stop showing it once a passphrase exists.
