// Plain "YYYY-MM-DD" strings (booking_date, sale_date, spent_at) are sliced

// stored as a FULL UTC timestamp (new Date().toISOString()) — that also
// starts with 10 digits matching this shape, but slicing it reads off the
// UTC calendar date, not the IST one. Only take the slice fast-path for
// strings that are exactly a plain date with no time component; anything
// longer is bucketed by explicit IST (UTC+5:30) arithmetic below.
//
// IMPORTANT: this used to read the bill_date's calendar day/month via
// `x.getFullYear()`/`getMonth()`/`getDate()` — but those are the JS
// runtime's LOCAL timezone, not IST specifically. That's the same class of
// bug this file exists to prevent: it silently gave the right answer only
// because the app happens to run on devices already set to IST, and
// silently gave the WRONG answer the moment it ran anywhere else (a CI
// runner, a differently-configured device, a browser with its clock set
// wrong) — a bill made in the last ~5.5 hours of the UTC day would land in
// the wrong month/day exactly like the bug this comment used to warn
// against, just one layer further out. IST has no daylight-saving shifts,
// so a fixed +5:30 offset applied to the UTC instant — then read back with
// UTC getters — gives the correct IST calendar date regardless of what
