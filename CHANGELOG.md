# Changelog

All notable changes to this consolidation are recorded here, newest first.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Cash / online split for every payment.** A collection can now be part cash,
  part UPI/Card, on every screen that takes money: Home "Collect now", the
  Bills quick-pay row, Turf "Collect" / "Mark paid", the booking advance,
  a UPI snack bill (optional cash part), and settling a customer tab. Each
  receipt of money is stored as its own row in the new `payments` table
  (database v10; included in backups, archives and "clear all data"), dated the
  day it arrived — so the cash drawer and the monthly Cash/Online split now
  count dues collected today on older bookings, and an advance no longer shows
  on the game day. Existing data reads exactly as before (see
  `docs/calculation-rules.md` §2c). Receipts, the Excel exports and the bill's
  "Paid via" line show the split ("Cash ₹700 + UPI ₹300").
- **The cash/online split now reaches everywhere it was still missing:**
  a merged bill can take a UPI or split payment like any other bill; the
  customer dialog's per-line "Collect"/"Mark paid" and "Settle all" ask cash
  vs. online instead of always recording Cash (a "Settle all" split is
  allocated across every open booking/bill/tab it covers); raising a
  booking's advance during an edit asks how the extra was paid and records
  it as a real row instead of a silent field bump; correcting a snack
  sale's payment mode after the fact now actually replaces its payment rows
  (not just a display field); and an expense can now be logged as UPI/Card
  with an optional "Paid in cash" part, so the cash-drawer reconciliation no
  longer assumes every expense left the drawer as cash. See
  `docs/calculation-rules.md` §2c for the details.

### Removed

- The unfinished GitHub-backup module (`src/lib/github.ts`, `github.test.ts`,
  the `readGithubConfig`/`writeGithubConfig` credential slot). It was never
  wired into any UI component, so this is a source-tree cleanup only.

### Fixed

- **Year-archiving saved cleartext data to a shared folder:** `archiveYear()`
  now encrypts the `.db` file it writes locally with the same backup
  passphrase as a full backup (`encryptFullBackupBytes` in
  `telegram-backup.ts`), before it lands in the public Downloads/Documents
  location — a whole year of bookings/sales no longer sits there in plain
  JSON. **This does not retroactively re-encrypt anything:** if you already
  have a `Turf bookings and sales - <year>.db` file in Downloads from
  before this fix, that specific file is still plaintext — move it
  somewhere secure or delete it once you've confirmed the archived data
  reached Telegram safely. Archives made after this fix are fine as-is.
- **Security regression from the GitHub-backup work, now reverted along with
  it:** `keyring_get_token`/`keyring_set_token`/`keyring_delete_token`
  (desktop) and `secureSet`/`secureGet`/`secureDelete` (Android) had started
  accepting a caller-supplied credential name straight from the webview with
  no validation, so any script running in the webview could read, overwrite,
  or delete an arbitrary named entry in the OS credential store (or this
  app's encrypted Android prefs) — not just this app's own secrets. Both are
  back to a fixed allowlist of known slots (`telegram-backup-token`,
  `telegram-backup-extra-tokens`, `backup-passphrase`); `service` on desktop
  is hardcoded again and never passed from JS. See `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and
  `AndroidSavePlugin.kt`.
- Removed `https://api.github.com` from the CSP `connect-src` in
  `tauri.conf.json` now that nothing calls it.

### Added

- Receipt-photo integrity checking end to end:
  - `uploadReceipt()` now rejects a file whose bytes don't sniff as a real
    image (`sniffImageMimeType`/`isLikelyImageFile` in `image.ts`), instead
    of trusting the extension-derived `File.type` a renamed non-image file
    can spoof.
  - `uploadReceipt()` records a SHA-256 of every stored photo at capture
    time (`db.receipt_hashes`, schema v7).
  - `buildReceiptsArchive()` hashes every packed photo, writes the hash into
    `manifest.json`, and self-verifies the generated archive before
    returning it (`verified`/`hashMismatch` in the result).
  - `importReceiptsArchive()` checks each restored file's hash against the
    manifest before writing it; a mismatch is reported as `corrupted`
    (naming the affected `expense_no`) and not written. A manifest with no
    `sha256` field (an older archive) restores as before but is counted
    `unverifiable`, not `corrupted`.
  - New standalone `verifyReceipts()` in `receipts-share.ts` plus a "Verify
    receipts" button in `ReceiptsCard.tsx` — checks every expense's receipt
    photo against its capture-time hash on demand, independent of any
    import/export.
  - "View receipt" on a photo that isn't on this device now names the
    expense's reference number in the toast (`missingReceiptMessage()` in
    `expenses.ts`) instead of a bare "not found" error.
- `backup.test.ts`: regression test asserting `buildBackup()`'s output never
  contains a `receipts` key or any receipt photo bytes.
- `receipts-share.test.ts` / `image.test.ts` / `expenses.test.ts`: coverage
  for the signature check, hash round-trip, corrupted-file detection, and
  legacy-archive handling above.
- `fake-indexeddb` as a dev dependency, so tests that exercise real `db`
  reads/writes (backup, receipts-share, expenses) run against an actual
  in-memory IndexedDB instead of needing a browser.

### Changed

- `pushSizeCheck()`'s over-100MB message now also suggests local
  export/import as an alternative to archiving old years — wording ported
  over from the `turf-ledger-fixed` branch during the repo-consolidation
  pass (see `docs/android-port-notes.md` §0 note at the top of this file's
  history).

### Added

- Cash/UPI payment-mode picker on every tab-payment collection point: the
  Dues tab collect box, "Settle all", and the customer tab card. The chosen
  mode is saved on the payment record and shown in the ledger.
- `theme.test.ts`: verifies the resolved-CSS theme cache — `applyTheme()`
  caches both light and dark CSS in one call, and `applyCachedMode()`
  restores byte-identical values on every light ⇄ dark toggle instead of
  re-running the color math.
- `expenses.test.ts`: regression coverage for `planRecurringPosts()` — IST
  day-of-month arrival, the plain `YYYY-MM-DD` `spent_at` shape, and the
  31st-clamped-to-month-end rule.
- IST calendar-bucketing test cases appended to `analytics.test.ts` for
  `dayKey()`/`monthKey()`, including cross-midnight UTC/IST cases and
  runtime-timezone independence.

### Fixed

- Four remaining UTC-vs-IST date slices, all following the same rule already
  documented in `docs/calculation-rules.md` (route through `monthKey()`/
  `dayKey()`, never re-slice a UTC timestamp):
  - Excel export filenames (`xlsx.ts`)
  - Layout-preset export filenames (`ArrangeToolbar.tsx`)
  - The print-test receipt date (`PrintSettingsCard.tsx`)
  - Recurring-expense auto-posting (`expenses.ts`) — auto-posted rows now
    store a plain local date like every other expense (previously a UTC
    `toISOString()` that plain-date-equality filters, like the day filter
    and the receipt-upload folder, silently never matched), post on the IST
    calendar day rather than the runtime's local day, and clamp a rule for
    "the 31st" to the last day of a shorter month instead of rolling into
    the next month.

### Changed

- Settings tab reordered to a usage-priority sequence — data-safety tools
  (Backup & restore, Receipts sharing) first, daily operational settings
  next, occasional/advanced tools last — per
  `.lovable/plan/optimize-the-settings-tab-order-2026-09-05.md`. Existing
  saved layouts are migrated to the new order once; later manual
  rearrangements are preserved and not repeatedly overwritten.
- `docs/README-theme-picker.md` rewritten: it previously described an older
  HSL, single-mode version of the theme engine. It now documents the actual
  oklch color space, the independent light/dark color pairs, the
  contrast-safety clamps, and the resolved-CSS cache.
- `docs/calculation-rules.md` updated to list the call sites already audited
  against the UTC/IST date rule.

### Known gaps

- The roadmap line "theme card redesign / resolved-CSS cache verification"
  had two parts. Only the cache-verification half had a concrete, checkable
  spec (now done, see `theme.test.ts`). No design brief for a
  `ThemeCustomizerCard.tsx` visual redesign was found anywhere in the repo
  (`.lovable/plan/`, `roadmap.md`, or elsewhere) — if one was intended, it
  needs its own spec before that work can start.
